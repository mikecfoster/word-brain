# word-brain
Stuck on a level of word-brain and do not want to pay for hints.

So developing a search algorithm to help out.

Started with a breadth-first search from [red blob games](https://www.redblobgames.com),
a very good resource for game related algorithms and grest visualisations - check it out.

But what I really need is a depth-first search so another approach is needed.
